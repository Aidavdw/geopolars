    | in | empty when |

    | `LineStringXY[ZM]` | it has no vertices |
    | `PolygonXY[ZM]` | it has no rings, or only rings without vertices |
    | `MultiPointXY[ZM]` | it has no points |
    | `MultiLineStringXY[ZM]` | it has no parts, or only parts without vertices |
    | `MultiPolygonXY[ZM]` | it has no polygons, or only polygons without vertices |

    By default, this only checks for outer emptiness.
    A linestring with only empty points would still not be considered empty.
    A single non-empty point makes it non-empty.
    A null geometry is neither empty nor not: it gives null.
    With `check_nested=True`, any geometry but a point is also empty
    when all of its points are empty (NaN `x` and `y`).
    This would catch a case like a linestring with only empty points,
    but as it reads every coordinate, it is much slower.

    ```python
    df.filter(~geo.is_empty("parcel"))

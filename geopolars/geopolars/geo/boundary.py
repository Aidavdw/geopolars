    m is a measure along the line rather than a position, so it is not compared.
    A closed linestring, or one with a single vertex, has an empty boundary.

    A polygon without rings, or a linestring without vertices, gives an empty boundary.
    A missing geometry gives a missing boundary.
    Points and multipoints have no boundary, and are refused.

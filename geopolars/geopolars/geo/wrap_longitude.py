    The range is one full turn in the CRS's unit (360 for degrees, 400 for grads),
    from `start` to `start + turn`.
    By default it is centred on the prime meridian: `[-180, 180]` for degrees,
    so 190 becomes -170, -200 becomes 160, and 540 becomes 180.
    Data that runs from 0 to 360 instead, as many climate and ocean grids do,
    passes `start=0`: then -10 becomes 350, and 370 becomes 10.
    The CRS cannot say which convention data uses (EPSG:4326 covers both),
    which is why it is up to the caller.
    Coordinates already in range are left as they are, including both ends.
    Only `x` moves: `y`, `z` and `m` are untouched.

    Each vertex moves on its own, which can tear a geometry apart.
    A line from 170 to 190 becomes one from 170 to -170, which runs the long way round.
    With `skip_crossing`, a geometry whose vertices would not all move by the same number
    of turns is left as it is, still past the edge.
    A geometry that lies entirely past it is still moved, and moves as a whole.

    The geometry needs a geographic CRS: without one there is no longitude to wrap,
    and the expression is refused while the plan is built.

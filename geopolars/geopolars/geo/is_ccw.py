    A linestring has to run counter-clockwise.
    A polygon has to have its exterior counter-clockwise and its holes clockwise.
    With `holes_cw=False`, its holes have to run counter-clockwise too.
    The default is how GeoParquet and OGC wind a polygon.
    A multilinestring or multipolygon has to have every part run that way.

    | `LineStringXY[ZM]` | `bool` |
    | `PolygonXY[ZM]` | `bool` |
    | `MultiPointXY[ZM]` | refused |
    | `MultiLineStringXY[ZM]` | `bool` |
    | `MultiPolygonXY[ZM]` | `bool` |

    The orientation is the sign of the area the ring encloses in x and y; z and m are ignored.
    An empty linestring, ring, polygon or multi runs either way, so it gives `True`.
    Any other ring that encloses nothing (too few vertices, all on a line,
    or with a NaN vertex) runs neither way, so it gives `False`.

    Whether a line is closed is not checked: an open line is taken as closed back to its start.
    Combine with `is_ring` or `is_valid` to check that too.

    df.select(geo.is_ccw("parcel"))

"""The centroid of a geometry: the centre of its length or area.
Note that this is not the mean coordinate, which weighs every vertex the same!

A native kernel (A-tier) does either in one pass over the storage:
it weighs every segment of a linestring by its length,
and applies the shoelace formula over a polygon's planar area.
A multilinestring or multipolygon gets the centroid of its parts together,
each weighted by its length or area.
A (multi)point has neither length nor area,
so its centroid is its mean coordinate (C-tier).

    """The centroid of a polygon (centre of area) or linestring (centre of length).

    A polygon's centroid is measured on the plane the coordinates lie in,
    even when they carry a CRS, and the CRS is carried over to the result.
    Holes are taken out.
    Its 'x' and 'y' are the centroid of its footprint (its shadow on the x/y plane),
    and its 'z' and 'm' are averaged over that footprint's area.
    For a flat 3D polygon, that puts the centroid on the polygon,
    right above the centroid of its footprint.
    The result keeps the polygon's dimension.
    A vertical polygon has a footprint that encloses nothing, so it has no centroid.

    A linestring's centroid is the midpoint of each of its segments,
    weighted by that segment's length.
    Fully three-dimensional if 'z'.
    If the line has an 'm', it is averaged.
    The result keeps the line's dimension.
    A null linestring, an empty one,
    and one without length (a single vertex, or all on one spot) have no centroid.

    A null geometry, an empty polygon, and a polygon that encloses nothing
    (all of its vertices on a line) have no centroid.

    A multilinestring or multipolygon gets a single centroid:
    that of each part (measured as for a lone linestring or polygon),
    weighted by its length or area.
    A part without length or area adds nothing.
    A null geometry, an empty one,
    and one whose parts have no length or area at all have no centroid.

    A point is its own centroid.
    A multipoint gets a single centroid, which is the mean of its points
    (see `mean_coordinate`).
    A null or empty multipoint has no centroid.

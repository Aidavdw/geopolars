    z' = g·x + h·y + i·z + zoff
    ```

    A twelve-number matrix that reads `z` (`c` or `f` not 0)
    or changes it (a bottom row other than `0, 0, 1, 0`)
    is refused for a geometry with no `z`, rather than silently half applied.
    `m`, being a measure, is always carried through untouched.

    `origin` is the point the matrix is applied about, by default `(0, 0, 0)`:
    positions are taken relative to it, transformed, and put back,
    `x' = a·(x - origin_x) + b·(y - origin_y) + c·(z - origin_z) + xoff + origin_x`
    and likewise for `y` and `z`. The default leaves the matrix as shapely applies it.
    It is either
    - one point for the whole column, as `(x, y)` or `(x, y, z)`, or
    - a `geoarrow.point` column (or a single point) with a point for every geometry,
      such as `geo.mean_coordinate("shape")` to transform each geometry about its own middle.
      A geometry whose origin is missing comes out missing.
      An origin column that declares a CRS has to declare the geometry's.

    A `z` left out is 0.
    `translate`, `rotate`, `skew` and `scale` are each one of these,
    with the matrix worked out for you.
    Coordinates are transformed as they are, in the units of their CRS.

    """Draws a 'buffer' around the geometry.
    Think of it like an outset/inset of the original shape.
    Every point of this buffer is a polygon with points is within `distance` of the original.
    `distance` is in the units of the coordinates
    (degrees for longitude/latitude).
    It is one number for every geometry,
    or a column (or expression) with one distance per geometry.
    A missing distance gives a missing polygon.
    A NaN or infinite distance in a column raises, as does a negative one with `side`.
    With `ignore_per_row_errors=True`, such a row gives a missing polygon instead.

    A point, linestring or polygon gives a polygon.
    Their multi-variants give a multipolygon,
    in which parts whose buffers overlap are merged into one.
    The output is always XY:

    | in | out | with `allow_splitting`, and `distance` a column or at most 0 |
    | - | - | - |
    | `PointXY[Z][M]` | `PolygonXY` | `MultiPolygonXY` |
    | `LineStringXY[Z][M]` | `PolygonXY` | `MultiPolygonXY` |
    | `PolygonXY[Z][M]` | `PolygonXY` | `MultiPolygonXY` |
    | `MultiPointXY[Z][M]` | `MultiPolygonXY` | `MultiPolygonXY` |
    | `MultiLineStringXY[Z][M]` | `MultiPolygonXY` | `MultiPolygonXY` |
    | `MultiPolygonXY[Z][M]` | `MultiPolygonXY` | `MultiPolygonXY` |

    {computed_by_geos_dropping_z_and_m}
    {empty_and_missing}
    A `distance` of at most 0 gives an empty polygon for a point or linestring.

    With `allow_splitting=True` and a `distance` column, or one of at most 0,
    every kind gives a multipolygon.
    A negative `distance` shrinks a polygon, which can split it into several polygons.
    Splitting can only happen when `distance` is at most 0:
    a positive buffer of a geometry in one piece stays in one piece.
    Take for example a dumbbell-like shape: two 4 by 4 squares, joined by a neck 0.4 wide.
    Shrunk by 0.5, the section in the neck vanishes, and two 3 by 3 squares are left.
    That shape can only be represented as a multipolygon.
    With `allow_splitting=True` and a negative `distance`, every row is a multipolygon,
    which holds both squares.
    At a `distance` of exactly 0, only a degenerate polygon splits (see `is_degenerate`),
    such as one whose exterior touches itself at a point.
    GEOS separates the pieces that only touch.
    A `distance` column has its sign only known per row,
    so with `allow_splitting=True` it always gives a multipolygon.

    With `distance>0`, splitting cannot occur, because the outset will always expand outwards.
    This means you can never end up with 'islands', so it is not necessary to output multipolygons.
    `allow_splitting=true` does not have to change the output type in this case.

    For geometries with a CRS, longitude/latitude the distance is in degrees, not along the globe.

    You can also customise the shape of the buffer!

    - `quadrant_segments` is the number of segments that approximate a quarter circle.
      It must be at least 1.
    - `cap_style` is how a line ends: `"round"` (the default), `"flat"` or `"square"`.
    - `join_style` is how two segments meet at a corner: `"round"`, `"mitre"` or `"bevel"`.
    - `mitre_limit` only goes with `join_style="mitre"`.
      A corner that sticks out more than `mitre_limit` times `distance` is bevelled.
      It defaults to 5.
    - `side="left"` or `side="right"` buffers only that side of a line,
      relative to its direction.
      It goes with a `distance` of at least 0, and has flat ends, so it takes no `cap_style`.
      A point has no sides, so it gets its regular buffer.
      A polygon or multipoint is refused.

    {geos_errors}
    The same goes for a polygon it splits without `allow_splitting`.

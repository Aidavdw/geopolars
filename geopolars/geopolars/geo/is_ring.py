    A multilinestring is a ring when its parts chain into one, in their order:
    each part ends where the next starts, and the last ends where the first starts.
    The joined line counts each joint once.
    An empty part breaks the chain.

    m is a measure along the line rather than a position, so it is not compared.
    4 vertices is a triangle plus the one closing it, so a closed line with fewer is no ring.

    An empty linestring or multilinestring is no ring. A null linestring gives a null result.

    This is what the polygon constructors check every ring against.

    """The rectangle a box describes, as a polygon with the box's dimension and CRS:
    `BoxXY` gives a `PolygonXY`, `BoxXYZ` a `PolygonXYZ`, and so on.

    The polygon has a single, counter-clockwise exterior ring of five vertices,
    starting and ending at `(xmin, ymin)`.
    z and m follow x: the two vertices at `xmin` take `zmin` and `mmin`,
    the two at `xmax` take `zmax` and `mmax`.
    Both ends of every range survive, and the ring stays flat:
    a plane tilting from the `xmin` side up to the `xmax` side.

    A box from 170 to -170 crosses the antimeridian.
    With a geographic CRS, its polygon runs from 170 to 190 instead:
    one full turn (360 degrees, or 400 grads) is added to `xmax`,
    so the polygon covers the same side of the globe as the box.
    Subtract the turn again to bring a vertex back into range.
    Planar operations on such a polygon only see it as running to 190,
    so a point at -175 is not inside it to them.
    Without a geographic CRS there is no way around, and no polygon describes the box.

    An empty range is `inf` to `-inf`, or any other reversed range outside of x.

    df.select(geo.to_polygon("extent"))

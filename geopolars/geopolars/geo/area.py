    A CRS is ignored: for longitude/latitude that gives square degrees,

    The area is computed with the shoelace formula, in the unit of the coordinates squared.
    Only a polygon actually encloses something.
    This also considers its holes.
    A multipolygon gets the area of each of its polygons, in order, as a list;
    sum it with `.list.sum()` for the area of the whole
    (which assumes its polygons do not overlap, as the spec requires).
    Only the two-dimensional part is considered: 'z' and 'm' are ignored.
    For a 3D polygon that gives the area of its footprint
    (its shadow on the x/y plane), not the area of its surface in 3D:
    a tilted polygon gets less than its true area, and a vertical one gets `0.0`.

    An empty polygon encloses nothing, so it gets `0.0`.
    Every other geometry (points, linestrings and their multi forms)
    is refused while the plan is built,
    unless `allow_non_polygons` is set: then each of them gets `0.0`
    (and a null stays null).

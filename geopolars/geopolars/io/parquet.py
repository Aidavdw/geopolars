"""Reading and writing GeoParquet files.

A GeoParquet file is a Parquet file with a `geo` key in its metadata.
It says which columns hold geometries, how, and in which CRS.
Reading and writing the file is done with Polars' own readers and writers.
This module only has the steps around them:
`from_geoparquet` gives the geometry columns their dtypes after reading,
and `geoparquet_metadata` (with `with_covering`) gives the `geo` key to write.

    Geoparquet only saves metadata stuff in the geo footer.
    Polars saves the type information (e.g. PolygonXY),
    but other software does not.
    We can figure out the dimensions from struct names though,
    and we can re-read the footer (which is why we need `path`).

    `frame` is what `pl.read_parquet` or `pl.scan_parquet` read from `source`.
    The columns get geopolars dtypes, with the metadata of the files in `source`.
    Native encodings become e.g. `PolygonXY`,
    and WKB becomes `Wkb` (which you can decode to native yourself with `geo.from_wkb`).
    A file without GeoParquet metadata leaves the frame as it is.
